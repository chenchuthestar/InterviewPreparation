Docker Trainig edureka: 
----------------------
When ever we install docker the default file system is created in Host medchine.
 in Linux :   /var/lib/docker
 in Windows : C:\Program Files\Docker
 
 Don't change any thing in this files or file structres.
 
 All imges and containers will store in this directory structre.
 

==============================================================================CLASS 2 :================================================================
 We can create container in three modes.
    1. Fore ground mode
	2. Detach mode   /Interactive terminal detached  (ITD)
	3. Interactive termial mode (IT)
	
	1.Fore Ground mode:
	----------------
	In this mode ,the container will create in shell 
	1.'docker run' command and 'docker container' run command both are same.
	2. docker run image check the image existance in locally,if it not found then get it from docker hub.
	  docker ps -a   ->  to check the running containers
    3. in fore ground mode container create and keeps waiting for reponse.we cannot use the shell for any other purpose.
	4. docker run command first time only download image from docker hub.
	5.by default docker assign two properties for container (container id,container name)
	6. no two containers have same id and same name.
	7. if we dont assingn name then docker assign name to container.
	8. if we want to give custom name.
	    docker run --name chenchu  nginix
	9.we cannot change container id but we can change container name.
	    docker rename <continer id>  <target_name>
		docker rename ae3wdwe chenchu_the_star
		
		19:32
		
	2.Detach mode / Interactive termial detached (ITD) :
	 ------------------------------------------------
	 
	 1.if we create container in ITD  mode ,it will start container then shell entered/login into container.
	   docker run -itd --name ubunutu_contaner  ubuntu 
	  in the case of some servers we using in contaner we have give some bash to command to enter into shell.
	    docker run -itd --name chenchu_container  nginix  bash
	 2.if we come out of container by exitor ctrl+c then container will stopped then shell come out of container .
	 3.if we want to come out of shell without stopping container , press  ctrl+p+q.
	 
	   
	   
Q) Difference between 'docker ps'  and 'docker ps -a' ?
     docker ps -> it shows containers which are running.
	 docker ps -a -> it shows all containers irrespective of state
	 
Q)what the information provide 'Docker ps' command ?
     COTAINER ID :  container unique id
	 IMAGE :        Image name used to create contaner 
	 COMMAND :      entrypoint command 
	 CREATED :      container creatd date
	 STATUS :       current status of container
	 PORTS :        port running in image
	 NAMES:         container name
Q)What is docker inspect command ?
     it shows the all the information about  container.
	 docker inspect <container id>

 ***  if we wantto go inside a contaner which is already running .
       docker exec -it <conatiner_id>  /bin/sh
	   docker exec -it 23456sdf  /bin/sh
	  
  *** if we want to execute the command without entering  into contaner
         docker exec 34sdf345 touch  /tmp/amit
		 
  *** if we want to stop/start/restart container
       
	     docker stop/start/restart <container_id>
		 
  ** if we want kill the docker container 
       
	   docker kill 2345asdf3
	   
	    if we stop container with kill command the STATUS of that container is 'Exited (137) ....'
		Killing a container means just stopping the container forcefully.
 *****  if we want to get only contaner ids 
         docker ps -a -q
		 
 **** if we want to delete the container we can use delete command.
       docker stop <containerId>
	   first we should container because running container we cannot stop
	   docker rm <container_id>
 **** if we want stop all containers at once
          docker stop  $(docker p -a -q)
 *** if we want delelte all containers
	   docker delete  $(docker p -a -q)
	   
 *** if we restart docker engine then all continer will not delete.
     those just in stopped state.
	 
 *** delete a container without stoppping.
    docker 	rm  <container_id> -f 
	
 **** if any application/service running in container that application/service by default cannot access from outside contaner.
      if we want access from out side there are two ways.
	  1.port forwardng         2.port binding
	  
	 PORT FORWARDING: in this docker assign random port to container/service.which this random port we can access application from outside.
	                  the port range 32768-65535.
					  docker run -itd  -P --name sridhar nginx 
					   here -P means we asking docker assign random port.
	 BINDING PORT :  we can tell docker on whcih port has to export.
	               docker run -itd  -p <outside_port:cotainer_inside_port> --name <containername> <image_name>
				   docker run -itd -p 81:80 --name mycontainer nginx
  
      if we want to know the container exposes which port after creation of container ,then we can see in three ways
        1.docker ps
        2.docker inspect <container_id> 
        3.docker port <contaner_id>		
				   
	 
	 only expose port during only run time.
	 If container already  started then we cannot Bind port .
	  
	  
	  
	  
 
 *******copy fie fom local system to container.
 
	  docker cp localfile  <container_id>::/<container_loc>
	  docker cp localfile.txt  46g478vb:/tmp
	  
 ****  copy file from container to local system
    docker cp  <container_id>::/<container_loc>   <localfile>
		  docker cp 46g478vb:/tmp  localfile.txt

  ****  if we want to see logs of container
        docker logs <container_id>
		
		docker logs fgtht4w245
		
        docker logs -f 345gn   ->  -f is for continous logs monitoring
		
 **** docker info   -> it provide some info docker in local.
 
 ***  docker stats -> it show statistics of each container like memory usage
                      docker by default use the what ever free memory is ther in system.
  ****  if we want to tell to docker to use max amount of memory.
           docker run -itd -P --memory 500MB nginx
		  this is not reserve the memory what we mentioned with --memory ,this property is only for specify max memory can utilize
  *** with in container if we want to see top process using more resources.
       docker top <container id>
	   
 *** to delete all container which are in stopped state or in running.
     docker container prune
	 
ReStart Policy :
---------------
this policy tells what action auto perform if container fails/goes down.
 THere are three restart policy are avaiable.
   1.No
   2.on-failure   : if exit code is other than 0 ,then container restart.
   3.Always  : it always start the 
   4.unless-stopped: other than stop manually ,in any case container will start container.
   
   docker run -itd -P --restart always tomcat
   
Q)Where exactly containers information store in local file system ?
   /var/lib/docker/containers/
  
 
***by default docker run command download the image and start container .
   if we want to only download the docker image then use docker pull.
     docker pull tomcat
	 
*** if we want to see all properties related to image then we can user inspect command
     docker inspect <imagename>

*** if we want to check history of image 
      docker history <imagename>
