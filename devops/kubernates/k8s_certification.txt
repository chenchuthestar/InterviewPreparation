WE cannot  delete kubernate contaners ,we can delete the pods.in Kubernate everything will be managed in the form if pod.

kubectl get pods -o wide
 it get the data of all pods with each pod running in which node.
 THe decision which pod running in which pod is decided by 'SCHEDULAR' .
 
 SCHEDULAR:
 ---------
 this schdular follows different algorithms to run/launch the pod in  particular node.
 To convience to schedular there are different type ways avaialble.
 below is example in declarative approch of creation of pod.
  1. 'nodeName' is attribute to specify the which node to create pod.
   worker-pod2.yaml
   ---------------
      apiVersion: v1
	  kind: Pod
      meta-data:
        name: worker2-pod
	  spec:
	    containers:
		  -image: nginx
		   name:web-pod
		nodeName:worker2
		
		if the specified node os not avaible then schedular will not launch pod . it will be in pending stage
		
  2.nodeSelector atrribute we can use to provide multiple workers. any worker is down schedular give chance to another node.
      apiVersion: v1
	  kind: Pod
      meta-data:
        name: worker2-pod
	  spec:
	    containers:
		  -image: nginx
		   name:web-pod
		nodeSelector:
		  type:gpu
     
	   limitation of node selectors 
           i. We cannot specify  more than one lable.
           ii. we cannot specify different conditions.
        solution for above problem is  Affinity.we have multiple Affinity like nodeAffinity.
