How Spring Distrubuted Transaction Works:
-----------------------------------------
1.in distributed transaction multiple ResourceManager are involved in order to coordinate  the ResourceManager to TransactionManager.
2.In Distrubuted Transaction an application will ask a transaction and to commit or roll back Transaction.
3.a TransactionManager will follow two phase commit process to commit a distributed transaction.
4.in this two phase commit first a transactionmanager will ask all ResourceManager are you ready to commit and gets there response.
5.if all are responded positively then transactionManager will issue commit ,if any one responsed negatively then TransactionManager will issue rollback.


Trasaction Attributes:
--------------------
1.in realtime  pplications a transaction defined in a method can be called by clients.
2.Trasanction attributes are used to set the behavior of transaction.
3.There are three trypes of Attributes.
        1.propagation
		2.Isoloation
		3.Timeout.
Propagation:
-----------
A Propagation value tells a transaction manager weather it should a run a transation method in a exiting transaction or a new transaction or without transacton.
   i)Required: a Txs check for existing transaction if exist then runs tx method in a existing transaction.
                if no existing transaction then runs in methods in new transaction.
				
   ii)RequireNew: A transaction checks for existing transaction,if yes the suspend it and runs tx method in a new Transaction and  then resumes it.
                  if no existing then begin new transaction fpr transaction method.
   iii)Supports : in Transaction check fpr existing transaction,if yes then tx method in existing.
                  if No existing then runs a transaction method without begining a new transaction.
   iv)NotSupported:   A transaction check for existing transaction,if yes then suspend it,runs a transaction method without a transaction and resumes existing
                      transaction .
					  if no existing then runs a transaction method without transaction.
					   
   v)Mandatory: a Transaction check for existing transaction.if yes then runs transaction method in that existing transaction.if  NO Transaction then
                  throws exception.
  vi)never: a Transaction check for an existing transaction if yes then throws an exception if no then run transaction method without transaction.
  vii) Nested: a TransactionManager  check for existing transaction ,if yes then runs a transaction method in a nested transaction.
                 If NO existing transaction then begin a new transaction for a transaction method.
			
			
			
			
ISOLATION:
-----------
When multiple trasaction are working on same data parallely then concurrency problems occurs.to solve  this probels isoloation values used.

    DirtRead problem: 1.This problem occures when a first transaction is reading the data  updated by second trasanction beofre the 2nd one commit the changes.
	            fc2       2.if second transaction roll back the chanegs then the 1st transaction has got dirty data.
	
	Non-Repeatable Read:
	            1.This problem occurs,when a transactio  is executing same query twice and if there are some changes in data in second time read than first time.
				2.This changes occured because in the middle of two reads another parallel transaction has updated the data.
				
	Fantam Read: 1.this problem occurs when a transactio is executing a query with a range for twice and it has observed some more or less rows at second time 
	               than first time.
				 2. This proble  is occured because another parallel transaction has inserted or deleted a row matching the range used by first transaction.
				 
				 
	THere are four isolation levels defined for transaction to prevent transaction concurrency.
	1.Read Uncommited: It is default,it does not prevent any problem.
	2.Read Commited:  It prevent dirty read problem.
	3.Repeatable Read:  It prevents dirty read and non-repeatable read problem.
	4.Serializable: it prevents dirty read ,non-repetable read,fantom read problems.
