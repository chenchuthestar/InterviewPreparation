1.local variable type inheritance
-------------------------------------
var keyword not allowed for lambda expression syntax
var keyword not allowed as global variable
we cannot assign null for var.
var keyword not allowed in method/constructor parameters...
diamond operator with collection with Local Variable Type Inference not applicable,jvm allows any object to collection.

2.Java 10 API changes
--------------------
 copyOf():  this method added in list,set,Map in order to create  UnModifiable List,Set and Map.
              var newunModifiableList=List.copyOf(oldList);
			  
 
 Collectors class has toList(),toSet(),toMap() static methods to get list or set or MAP OF elements from streams.
 
         JAVA 10  Has provided the following methods to Collectors class to provide UnModifiable/immutable List,Set and Map.
		   1.punlic static List unmodifiableList()
		   2.public static Srt unmodifiableSet()
		   3.public static Map unmodifiableMap()
	
	
Consolidated the JDK forest into a Single Respository:
-----------------------------------------------------
upto java 9 version, the complete java has devided into repositories like root corba,hotspot,jdk,langtools,jaxp,jaxw,nashorn but,java 10 version all these 
repositories are provided into single Repository under src inorder to simplify and streamline Development.

Garbage-COllector interface:
----------------------------
upto java 9 version,DIfferent Garbage Collectors are existed in java likeG1,CMS....
Which are available in different modules in java,they are not providing cleaner implementation,but JAVA 10 version has introduced 
GC interface for cleaner implementation of Garbage collectors.
