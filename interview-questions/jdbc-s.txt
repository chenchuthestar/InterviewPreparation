JDBC:
----
JDBC Features:
1) JDBC API is Standard API. We can communicate with any Database without rewriting our Application i.e. it is Database Independent API.
2) JDBC Drivers are developed in Java and hence JDBC Concept is applicable for any Platform. i.e.JDBC Is Platform Independent Technology.
3) By using JDBC API, we can perform basic CRUD Operations very easily
4)JDBC API supported by Large Number of Vendors and they developed multiple Products based on JDBC API.


Differences Between JDBC and ODBC:
--------------------------------------------------
ODBC                                                   					 JDBC
---------------------------------------------------   			-------------------------------------
1) ODBC Stands for Open Database Connectivity                 1) JDBC Stands for Java Database Connectivity
2) Introduced by Microsoft. 								  2) Introduced by Sun Micro Systems.
3) We can Use ODBC for any Languages like C, C++, Java, Etc   3) We can Use JDBC only for Java Language
4)We can use ODBC only for Windows Platforms.                 4)We can use JDBC for any Platform.
5) Mostly ODBC Drivers are developed in Native Languages      5) Mostly JDBC Drivers are developed in Java.
   like C OR C++.
6)For Java Applications, it is not recommended to use ODBC    6)For Java Applications, it is highly recommended
 because Performance will be Down due to Internal                to use JDBC because there is no Performance 
 Conversions and Application will become Platform Dependent.       Problems and Platform Dependency Problems.
 
 Q)executeQuery() Vs executeUpdate() Vs execute()?
   1.Select Query then we should use "executeQuery() Method".
   2.Non-Select Query then we should use executeUpdate() Method.
   3.Query dynamically at  Runtime then we should go for execute() Method
		ex:boolean b = st.execute(sqlQuery);  
		ResultSet rs =st.getResultSet(); 
		int rowCount=st.getUpdateCount();
   
 Q)Steps to implement JDBC Connection?
			import java.sql.*;
			public class Type1DriverDemo
			{
				public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
				{
					Class.forName("oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver");
					Connection con= DriverManager.getConnection(""jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:XE","scott","tiger");
					Statement st = con.createStatement();
					ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("select * from movies");
					while(rs.next())
					{
						System.out.println(rs.getInt(1)+"\t"+rs.getString(2)+"\t"+rs.getString(3)+"\t"+rs.getString(4));
					}
					con.close();
				}
			}
Q)Differences between Statement And PreparedStatement ?
 
		Statement										 PreparedStatement
		---------										-------------------
	1.At the time of creating Statement Object,      	    1.At the time of creating PreparedStatement,we have to provide SQL Query compulsory
		we are not required to provide any Query.		      and will send to the Database and will be compiled.
	2.Whenever we are using execute Method,                 2. Whenever we are using execute Method, Query won't be compiled just will be executed.
	  every time Query will be compiled and
	  executed.
		 
	3.Statement Object can work only for Static Queries.   3. PS Object can work for both Static and Dynamic Queries.

	4) Relatively Performance is Low                       4. Relatively Performance is High.
		 
	5) Best choice if we want to work with                 5.Best choice if we want to work with only one Query but required to execute multiple times.
	   multiple Queries.
	6)There may be a chance of SQL Injection               6.There is no chance of SQL Injection Attack.
	   Attack
	7)Inserting Date and Large Objects (CLOB and           7) Inserting Date and Large Objects (CLOB and BLOB) is easy.
		BLOB) is difficult. 
	
Q)What is CallableStatement ?
	If we want to call stored procedure from java application, then we should go for CallableStatement.
	CallableStatement is an interface present in java.sql package and it is the child interface of PreparedStatement.
	EX:CallableStatement cst = con.prepareCall("{call addProc(?,?,?)}");// procedure call
			cst.setInt(1, 100);  //IN-PARAM
			cst.registerOutParameter(3,Types.INTEGER); //OUT PARAM
			cst.execute();//Execute
			int result=cst.getInt(3);//get results
			
			CallableStatement cst=con.prepareCall("{?=call getAllEmpInfo4(?,?)}");
							cst.setInt(2,1000);
							cst.setInt(3,2000);
							cst.registerOutParameter(1,OracleTypes.CURSOR);


Q)SQL Injection Attack ?
	Every time the query will be compiled and executed. Some times end user may provide special
	characters as the part user input,which may change behaviour of sql query.This is nothing but SQL
	Injection Attack,which causes security problems.
	
	But in the case of PreparedStatement query will be compiled at the beginning only without
	considering end user's input. User provided data will be considered at the time of execution only.
	Hence as the part of user input,if he provides any special characters as the part of input,query
	behaviour wont be changed. Hence there is no chance of SQL Injection Attack in
	PreparedStatement.
	
	Ex:select * from users where uid=101 OR 1=1;

Q)Statement vs PreparedStatement vs CallableStatement:
	1. We can use normal Statement to execute multiple queries.
			st.executeQuery(query1)
			st.executeQuery(query2)
			st.executeUpdate(query2)
		i.e if we want to work with multiple queries then we should go for Statement object.
	2. If we want to work with only one query,but should be executed multiple times then we should go for PreparedStatement.
	3. If we want to work with stored procedures and functions then we should go for CallableStatement.
	
Q)Differences Between ResultSet and RowSet ?

				ResultSet      											RowSet
	-----------------------------     						 --------------------------------------
	
	1) ResultSet present in java.sql Package             1)RowSet present in javax.sql Package.
	2)By Default ResultSet is Non Scrollable and         2) By Default RowSet is Scrollable and Updatable Non Updatable (Forward only and Read only).
	3)ResultSet Objects are Non Serializable and         3)) RowSet Objects are Serializable and hence we can send over Network
		we can't send over Network
	4) ResultSet Objects are Connection oriented         4)RowSet Objects are Connection Less Objects i.e. we can access RowSet Data without having Connection to DB (except JdbcRowSet)
		i.e. we can access ResultSet Data as long as
		Connection is available once Connection closed
		we can't access ResultSet Data.
		
	5)ResultSet Object is not having Event Notification  5)RowSet Object is having Event Notification Model.
	  Model.

=================================================================Servlets========================================================================
Q)What is servlet ?
  Servet is a server side java class it extends the functionality of server.
  
Q)Different ways of creating a Servet class? 
   Servlet api given three ways 
		1.By implementing Servlet intterface.
		2.By Extending GenericServlet abstract class.
		3.By extending HttpServlet.
		  
			Servlet (i)
			   |
			   |
		 GenericServlet (AC)
		       |
			   |
			   |
			HttpSerlvet(AC)
			   |
			   |
	       CustomServlet(C)
 i)GenericServletis abstact class because it has ne abstract method called service()
 ii)HttpServlet is also an abstract class but it does not have any abstract methods.
Q)What are different methods in Servlet interface ?
    1.public void init() throws ServletException
	2.service(ServletRequest req,ServletResponse res)
	3.public void destroy();
	4.public ServletConfig getServletConfig();
	5.public String getServletInfo();
Q) What is servlet Lifecycle ?
     1.Does not exist state
	 2.Instatiated     (1st request or when deployed)
	 3.Initialized     (by calling init() method)
	 4.service         (container calls)
	 5.Destroy         (if servlet object no more required then container distroy the object by calling ddstroy method)
	  
	   As the part of lifecycle ,webcontainer calls three lifecycle methods ,Below are syntax of three lifecycle methods.
	     1.public void init( ServletConfig config) throws ServletException     --> called only once at initialze time
		 2.public void service(ServletRequest req,ServletResponse res) throws ServletException,IOException  -> called multiple time per request once 
		 3.public void destroy()  -------> called once at destroy time.
	 
Q)How to configure Welcome?
   <welcome-file-list>
		<welcome-file>login.html</welcome.html>
	</Welcome-file-list>
	If application contains Index.html and index.jsp pages then index.html is act as welcome page.
Q)What happens ig we don't override do get method for get request or dopost method for post request ?
	Htp status 405 error  well send to browser
Q)Why  HttpServlet class is given as an abstract class without abstract method ?
   In order to dis-allow or restrict programmer directly instatiate HttpServlet.
Q)Why HttpServlet class object Restricted ?
   If allowed then multiple objects can be created by programmer.then there will be no difference between CGI and Servlet technology.
Q)How to configure Servlet in web.xml ?
     <web-app>
	    <servlet>
		    <servlet-name>aliasname</servlet-name>
			<servlet-class>FullyQualifiedName</servlet-name>
		</servlet>
		<servlet-mapping>
		   <servlet-name>aliasname</servlet-name>
		   <url-pattern>UrlPattern</url-pattern>
		</servlet-mapping>
	 </web-app>
Q)What is InitParam and how to configure in web.xml?

Q)What is WEB application directory Structure ?
  |--------------
  | ProjectName |
  |--------------    |----------
         |-----------|  *.java |
		 |           |-----------
		 |
		 |          |----------

		 |				|------------> web.xml
		 |
		 |---------------------*.html
		                        *.jsp
								
Q) How to Get Serlvetconfig Object into Service method?
    1st way:
	-------
	   we override lifecycle init method in a servlet class then we neeed to store local servlet then we need store local ServletConfig to global servlet.
	   pulic class Myservlet extends GenericServlet 
	   {
	     private ServletConfig config;
		  public void init(ServletConfig config){
		      this.config=config;
		  }
	   }
	   
	   
	Approach 2:
	---------
	    call getServletConfig() method of super class.
		puvlic class Myservlet exteds GenericServlet{
		  public void service(req,res) throws Se,IOE
		  {
		   ServletConfig config=getServletConfig();
		  }
		}
		
Q)What are methods are in ServletConfig ?
   1.getServletName : to read alias name
   2.getInitParameter(key)-> to read value of init parameter based on its key.
   3.getInitParamerNames() ->it is to read allthe keys of inint oarameters at a time.the keys of init parameters are stored in Enumaratio  object.
        Enumeration e=config.getInitParametenames();
   4.it is to read context object from configure object
          Servlet ctx=config.getServletContext();
Q)Servlet Lifecycle ?
   1.Does not exist    2.Instatiated   3.Initilized   4.Service     5.Destroy.
   
     As the part of life cycle,webcontainer or servlet container calls threelife cycle methods.
	 As the part of lifecycle,Web contaner or servlet container cals three different lifecycle methods.
	     
		 1.public void init(ServletConfig config) throws ServletException
		 2.public void service(ServletRequest req,SevletResponse res) throw ServletException
		 3.public void destroy
Q)Lazy Loading and EalyLoading ?
   A servlet container will load a servlet when a servlet object when first request arraived by default ,It is called LAZY loading.
   In order to inform a servlet container about early loading we need to add <load-on-startup> tag under parent tag. the default value for <load-on-startup> tag is -1.
   if the value is negative integer then it will be lazyly loaded.
   if value is positive integet then it will be early loaded.
      <servlet>
	     <servlet-name>demo</servlet-name>
		 <servlet-class>DemoServlet</servlet-clas>
		 <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
	  </servlet>	 
Q)Can we write a parameterized constructor  in a servlet class? 
  By without writing a default Constructor ,we cannt write only parameter constructor in a Servlet class.
  A servlet Container create an object of a servlet class at a server side callling newInstace() method.
  This newInstace() check default constructor to create obejct.
Q)What happens ,if you don't override doGet() for get request or doPost methods  for post request ?
   Http status 405 error will be sent tobrowser.
   
Q) Types of URL patterns ?
    1.Exact match : 
		in web application ,if we created one servlet to handle  request coming from html page then we configure that servlet URL pattern in exact match.
		 <url-pattern>/srv1</url-pattern>
		 
	2.Directory match:
	      In a web application if we want to handle request which are coming from a group of html pages in one servlet then we need configure that servlet url pattern in directory match.
		  
		  <url-pattern>/a/b/*</url-pattern>
		  
	 3.Extension match 
	   If one servlet define to handle the request that are coming from all html pages of the web application then we configure that servet url-pattern in extension match.
	   <url-pattern>x.do</url-pattern>
Q)Whatis difference between init-parameter and context parameter ?
   a.init parameter are local to one servlet ,but context parameter are global to servlet.
   b.Init parameters arestored in servlet config  object ,context parameters are stored in context object.
Q) Life cycle and non-life cycle init() methods?
   1.GenericServlet  we have two inot methods,called lifecycle and non-life cycle.
   2.Life cycle init() method is inherited from Servlet interface and non-lifecycle init() method is added by generic Servlet.
     public void init(ServletCOnfig config)   -- life cycle init methods
	 public void init() throws ServletException -- non life cycle

Q)How many types of parameters are there in servlet technology?

   1.Init parameter
   2.Context parameters 
   3.request parameters
Q)What is difference between a parameter and attribute of a servlet context object ?
   a servlet can modify the values if attribute in servletcontext object but it cannot modify the valuesof thr parameter .so attribute values are not safe but paramters are safe.

Q)What is difference between ServletContext and ServletConfig ?   
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				ServletConfig                  			|                 ServletContext                     
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.ServletConfig is local to servlet                    | 1.ServletContext is global to all servlet
 2.it does not exists without a servlet					| 2.A servletContext is exist without servlet.
 3.A servlet config object can only store parameters    | 3.A servletContext Object can store both parameters
														|	and attributes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q) Excepton handling in Serlvet ?
    1.Programatic approach 
         include in try catch block
    2.Declarative approach 
         a.Configure <error-page> in web.xml	
		    <web-app>
			   <error-page>
			      <exception-type>java.lang.Exception</exception-type>
				  <location>/error.html</location>
			   </error-page>
			   <error-page>
			      <error-code>404</error>
				  <location>/error.html</location>
			   </error-pagge>
			 </web-app>
		b.We can configure error-page as html,jsp,servlet
		
Q)Difference between Webserver and ApplicationServer?

Q)Difference between forwarding and re-direction mechanishm?
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  |          Forwarding                                         |              Re-direction                                    |
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |  1.in forwanding a request will be forwarded at server    | 1.In redirection a request is redirected form servlet 1 to     |

 Q)When servlet object will be destroyed ?
  a Servlet object Will be destroy by  ServletCOntainerin the following three cases.
     1.When server shutdown .
	 2.When application un-deploy
	 3.When servlet object us waiting for reques from long time.
	 4.When we stop application execution
	 5.When we reload application execution.

Q)Session management techniques in servlets ?
