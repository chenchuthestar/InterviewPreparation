What is Generics ?

The main objective of Generics is to provide Type-Safety and to resolve Type-Casting problems.
introduced generics concept in 1.5v hence the main objectives of generics .
	1. To provide type safety to the collections.
	2. To resolve type casting problems.
Bounded types:
We can bound the type parameter for a particular range by using extends keyword such types are called bounded types.
class Test<T extends X>
{}
 1.If x is a class then as the type parameter we can pass either x or its child classes.
 2.If x is an interface then as the type parameter we can pass either x or its implementation classes.

 EX: class Test <T extends Number&Runnable> {}(valid)
As the type parameter we can pass any type which extends Number class and implements Runnable interface. 

*)We can't define bounded types by using implements and super keyword.

methodOne(ArrayList<? Extends x> l):
-----------------------------------	
1.If x is a class then this method is applicable for ArrayList of either x type or its child classes.
2.If x is an interface then this method is applicable for ArrayList of either x type or its implementation classes.
3.In this case also within the method we can't add anything to the List except null.

methodOne(ArrayList<? super x> l):
--------------------------------
1.If x is a class then this method is applicable for ArrayList of either x type or its super classes.
2.If x is an interface then this method is applicable for ArrayList of either x type or super classes of implementation class of x.
3.But within the method we can add x type objects and null to the List.
