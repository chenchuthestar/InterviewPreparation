Serialization:
-------------
1.The process of saving (or) writing state of an object to a file is called serialization
2.but strictly speaking it is the process of converting an object from java supported form to either network supported form (or) file supported form.
3.By using FileOutputStream and ObjectOutputStream classes we can achieve serialization process.

De-Serialization:
----------------
1.The process of reading state of an object from a file is called DeSerialization
2.. but strictly speaking it is the process of converting an object from file supported form (or) network supported form to java supported form.
3.By using FileInputStream and ObjectInputStream classes we can achieve DeSerialization.

Transient keyword:
-----------------
1.While performing serialization if we don't want to save the value of a particular variable to meet security constant such type of variable , 
 then we should declare that variable with "transient" keyword.
2.. At the time of serialization JVM ignores the original value of transient variable and save default value to the file .

Static VsTransient:
------------------
1.static variable is not part of object state hence they won't participate in serialization because of this declaring a static variable as transient there is no
   use.
  
 Transient Vs Final:
 ------------------
	final variables will be participated into serialization directly by their values. Hence declaring a final variable as transient there is no use. 

Object graph in serialization:
-----------------------------
   1.Whenever we are serializing an object the set of all objects which are reachable from that object will be serialized automatically.
    This group of objects is nothing but object graph in serialization.
   2.In object graph every object should be Serializable otherwise we will get runtime exception saying"NotSerializableException.

         import java.io.*;
	class Dog implements Serializable
	{
		Cat c=new Cat();
	}
	class Cat implements Serializable
	{
		Rat r=new Rat();
	}
	class Rat implements Serializable
	{
		int j=20;
	}
